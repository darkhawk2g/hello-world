# hello-world
This is my first GitHub project. I have created a repository. 
This is going to contain some information about me. 
I live in Toronto and have $10MM dollars now. I enjoy taking trips within this world and working with people to help them during their time of need. This is gratifying for me. I earn my $ through the real estate I own and my renters appreciate the work I do.
